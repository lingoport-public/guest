		<entry key="page.title">PEF Participants</entry>
		<entry key="information">This is a list of the members in your unit who have participated in the PEF loan program. This information is to assist priesthood leaders in providing support, encouragement, and guidance. We encourage leaders to review this list regularly and offer guidance to the members who are not continuing in school, have not graduated, or are not current on their PEF loan as they may be facing challenges completing their education and becoming self-reliant. The self-reliance committee and self-reliance specialists can work with these members under the direction of priesthood leaders. PEF participants may contact the <unit-card unit-number="{0}" show-org-info="true">PEF Support Center</unit-card> for help of any type, including when facing challenges repaying their loan.</entry>
